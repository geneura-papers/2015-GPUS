We provide a methodology to design and implement different neighborhood structures for LS algorithms on GPU.

The QAP is a classical combinatorial optimisation problem that is difficult to solve optimally for even small problems with over 30 items. By using graphic hardware acceleration, the developed SIMD-TS algorithm executes 20 to 45 times faster than traditional CPU code. The computational improvement is made possible by the utilisation of the parallel computing capability of a graphics processing unit (GPU). The speed and effectiveness of this algorithm are demonstrated on QAP library problems. The main contribution of this paper is a fast and effective SIMD-TS algorithm capable of producing results for large QAPs on a desktop personal computer equivalent to the results achieved with a CPU cluster.",

In TS for QAP, all neighbor moves are tested. These moves form two groups based on computing of move cost. In one group, the computing of cost is O(1) and in the other group, the computing of move cost is O(n). We compute these two groups of moves in parallel by assigning the computations to threads of CUDA. In this assignment, we propose an efficient method which we call Move-Cost Adjusted Thread Assignment (MATA). The results with GPU computation with MATA show a promising speedup compared to computation with the CPU. It is also shown that MATA is effective in applying 2-opt local search.},

Using three well-known benchmark problems and one real-life problem, we discuss the role of the parameters that characterize the evolutionary process of standard panmictic and parallel genetic programming. We find that distributing individuals between subpopulations offers in all cases studied here an advantage both in terms of the quality of solutions and of the computational effort spent, when compared to single populations. We also study the influence of communication patterns such as the communication topology, the number of individuals exchanged and the frequency of exchange on the evolutionary process. We empirically show that the topology does not have a marked influence on the results for the test cases studied here, while the frequency and number of individuals exchanged are related and there exists a suitable range for those parameters which is consistently similar for all the problems studied.},

After evaluating such a dEDA on several well-known discrete and continuous test problems, we conclude that our model clearly outperforms existing centralized approaches from a numerical point of view, as well as speeding up the search considerably, thanks to its suitability for physical parallelism.},

abstract="Evolutionary induction of decision trees is an emerging alternative to greedy top-down approaches. Its growing popularity results from good prediction performance and less complex output trees. However, one of the major drawbacks associated with the application of evolutionary algorithms is the tree induction time, especially for large-scale data. In the paper, we design and implement a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based parallelization of evolutionary induction of decision trees. We apply a Compute Unified Device Architecture programming model, which supports general-purpose computation on a GPU (GPGPU). The selection and genetic operators are performed sequentially on a CPU, while the evaluation process for the individuals in the population is parallelized. The data-parallel approach is applied, and thus, the parts of a dataset are spread over GPU cores. Each core processes the assigned chunk of the data. Finally, the results from all GPU cores are merged and the sought tree metrics are sent to the CPU. Computational performance of the proposed approach is validated experimentally on artificial and real-life datasets. A comparison with the traditional CPU version shows that evolutionary induction of decision trees supported by GPGPU can be accelerated significantly (even up to 800 times) and allows for processing of much larger datasets.",

abstract="In recent years, graphics processing units (GPUs) have emerged as a powerful architecture for solving a broad spectrum of applications in very short periods of time. However, most existing GPU optimization approaches do not exploit the full power available in a CPU--GPU platform. They have a tendency to leave one of them partially unused (usually the CPU) and fail to establish an accurate exchange of information that could help solve the target problem efficiently. Thus, better performance is expected from devising a hybrid CPU--GPU parallel algorithm that combines the highly parallel stream processing power of GPUs with the higher power of multi-core architectures. We have developed a hybrid methodology to efficiently solve optimization problems. We use a hybrid CPU--GPU architecture, to benefit from running it, in parallel, on both the CPU and the GPU. Our experiments over a heterogeneous set of combinatorial optimization problems with increasing dimensionality show a time gain of up to {\$}{\$}365{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}365{\texttimes}in our proposal, while demonstrating high numerical accuracy. This work is intended to open up a new line of research that matches both architectures with new algorithms and cooperation techniques.",
